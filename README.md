# casual-markdown-cv

[casual-markdown-cv](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv) is a minimal way to create markdown resume and available online (github-page or other static web hosting)

It is quite annoying to maintain resume in multiple format, MS Word, PDF, TXT as well as wanna to have an HTML format available online. 

Github markdown editor is very handy to draft a nice resume. Here is a sample template: [resume.md](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/blob/main/resume.md).

just add a little code to transform into online resume with [nice look](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume.html) (hosted at github).

then may print it to PDF file to send to recruiter, or share by url. (for github, it can accessed by raw.githack.com naturally)

ps: recommended to ask ChatGPT for a refinement before published your resume. AI will refine both content and layout in markdown format.

Sorry for my poor UI design, if still not good enough, please fork this repo and make your own.

## Usage

just fork [this repo](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv), and choose a resume template to revise.
then check html layout by https://raw.githack.com/YOUR-REPO-NAME/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume.html

by the way, this template basically use markdown as web page, which not limit for resume purpose. for example,

* [quotation.html](quotation.html) // Business Proposal and quotation [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/quotation.html)

## How it works

It loads dinamically the markdown using JS and the style is above it. Have a look into the template HTML and create your own.
